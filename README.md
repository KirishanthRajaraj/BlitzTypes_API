# BlitzTypes API

This is the backend API for [Blitz Types](https://github.com/KirishanthRajaraj/BlitzTypes), a typing practice web application.  
It is built with **.NET Web API** and uses **SQL Server** for data storage. The API handles user authentication via **JWT tokens**, processes typing results, and serves leaderboard and statistics data to the frontend.
